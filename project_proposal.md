# Project Proposal: Intelligent Communication Action Processor (ICAP)

## Project Charter

**Project Name:** Intelligent Communication Action Processor (ICAP)  
**Project Sponsor:** [Your Name]  
**Project Manager:** [To Be Assigned]  
**Date:** May 7, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0

### Purpose
The Intelligent Communication Action Processor (ICAP) is designed to automate the extraction and organization of action items from email and Slack communications. This hybrid cloud/local solution leverages advanced AI to identify tasks directed at the user, classify their priority, and generate organized summaries to improve productivity and ensure critical tasks aren't overlooked.

### Business Case
Knowledge workers spend an average of 28% of their workday managing email, with an additional 14% spent on internal communication platforms like Slack. Critical action items are frequently buried within these communications, leading to missed tasks, delayed responses, and reduced productivity. ICAP addresses these challenges by automating the identification and prioritization of action items, enabling users to focus on execution rather than communication management.
